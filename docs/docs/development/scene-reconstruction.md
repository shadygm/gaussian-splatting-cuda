# Scene reconstruction

Scene reconstruction is a viewport-only presentation stage. It changes the
internal resolution used to draw the current scene and reconstructs that image
at the viewport resolution. It never changes training tensors, model precision,
or data stored in a `.licht` project or exported splat file.

## Stable runtime contract

The scene reconstruction registry owns stable backend and preset identifiers.
The first implementation exposes:

| Backend ID | UI label | Presets | Temporal inputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `native` | Off | `native` (1.0) | None |
| `spatial` | Spatial | `quality` (0.75), `balanced` (0.67), `performance` (0.50) | None |

The renderer's existing `render_scale` remains the base scene scale. A selected
backend's input multiplier is applied independently, so reconstruction does not
rewrite the base control. Native presentation ignores the multiplier.

The requested backend, effective backend, fallback state, and runtime readiness
are distinct. The built-in spatial Vulkan pipeline is created lazily on first
use. If creation fails, the frame is presented through the native path and the
transition is logged; the saved request is not silently rewritten.

## Spatial path

Spatial reconstruction reuses the existing scene image and descriptor. The
viewport pass selects a fullscreen fragment pipeline that performs bounded
five-tap sharpening while sampling the reduced-resolution image. There is no
extra intermediate image, queue submission, CUDA conversion, history buffer,
motion-vector producer, jitter, or CPU fallback.

Split view uses the same sampling rule inside its existing composite shader.
Its content rectangle is transformed from the renderer coordinate extent to
the framebuffer extent before compositing, so letterboxing and the split
divider remain aligned at reduced internal resolutions.

## Persistence and safe mode

The selected backend and the last valid preset for each backend are user-global
preferences in `config/preferences.json`; they are not project state. Invalid
backend or preset identifiers fall back to the registry defaults. Safe mode
uses native presentation for the process and neither reads nor writes the saved
selection.

Future temporal and vendor backends must extend the same registry and effective
state contract, but their resource and synchronization lifecycles belong in
separate changes.
